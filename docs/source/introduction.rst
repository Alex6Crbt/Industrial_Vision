Welcome to Industrial_Vision, a Python-based project that combines computer vision, 
artificial intelligence, and servo motors to automate a sorting process 
based on shape recognition. With a camera positioned above a conveyor belt, this 
innovative project captures multiple images and utilizes live feed to train an AI 
model that recognizes shapes. The sorted objects are then directed to appropriate 
locations using servo motors, providing an efficient and streamlined sorting solution.

Project Overview
----------------

With Industrial_Vision, the primary objective is to develop a practical system that 
can accurately identify and sort objects based on their shapes. 

Shape recognition is achived by implementing a camera system above a conveyor belt to capture images of 
objects passing through. 

The images are processed using computer vision techniques,
and the extracted features are fed into an AI model for shape recognition.

To train the AI model, Using the scikit-learn library in Python, we have developed a training algorithm
for the AI model.

To generate a database for training the AI model, we have implemented code that
captures images of objects as they move along the conveyor belt. These images 
are labeled according to their corresponding shapes, creating a diverse dataset
that enables the AI model to learn and classify shapes effectively.


Once the AI model identifies the shape of an object, servo motors integrated into 
the conveyor belt system are triggered to sort the objects into appropriate locations. 
This servo motor-based sorting mechanism ensures precise and efficient placement of the 
objects based on their recognized shapes.

Key Features
------------

    
    1. Real-time image capture: The camera system positioned above the conveyor belt 
    captures images of objects as they pass through, providing a continuous stream of 
    data for processing and shape recognition.
    

    2. Computer vision-based shape recognition: Through computer vision techniques, 
    the project extracts relevant features from the captured images, enabling accurate 
    identification and classification of different shapes.

    
    3. AI model training: The scikit-learn library is utilized to train the AI model 
    on a labeled dataset, allowing it to learn and improve its ability to recognize 
    and classify shapes accurately.

    
    4. Servo motor-based sorting: Upon shape recognition, servo motors integrated into 
    the conveyor belt system are activated to sort the objects into appropriate locations, 
    ensuring efficient and precise sorting.

    
    5. Flexibility and customization: The project can be customized to accommodate 
    various shapes, sizes, and sorting criteria, making it adaptable to different 
    industries and applications.


Conclusion
----------

Industrial_Vision presents an innovative Python-based solution that combines 
computer vision, AI, and servo motor technology to automate the sorting process 
based on shape recognition. By capturing real-time images, training an AI model, 
and integrating servo motors, this project offers a streamlined and efficient 
solution for industries that require accurate shape identification and sorting.

While continuously improving the accuracy and efficiency of the system remains 
an ongoing endeavor, Industrial_Vision demonstrates the potential of leveraging Python's 
capabilities, computer vision techniques, and machine learning algorithms to create automated and intelligent sorting systems.
