Create\_DDB module
==================

The database generated by the `CreeBD` class is designed to train a neural network. Preprocessing 
plays a crucial role in simplifying the problem and improving the effectiveness of the neural network training process.

Preprocessing refers to the transformation and manipulation of the raw input data before feeding it 
into the neural network. It involves applying various operations to make the data more suitable for the 
learning algorithm. In the case of image data, preprocessing techniques significantly impact the network's performance and convergence.

The `CreeBD` class performs several preprocessing steps on the input images before generating the database:

1. Conversion to Grayscale: 

    The images are converted to grayscale using the `convert('L')` method. 
    Grayscale conversion simplifies the image representation by reducing it to a single channel, eliminating 
    the color information. This is also advantageous as it reduces the input dimensionality and removes 
    potential noise or variations caused by color channels.

2. Thresholding: 

    The `seuil` method applies a threshold to the grayscale image. Thresholding involves 
    converting the image into a binary format by assigning a fixed value to pixels based on a predefined 
    threshold. This help  in simplifying the image by distinguishing between foreground and background 
    regions or separating important features from the background.

3. Resizing: 

    The `resize` method resizes the image to a fixed width and height. Resizing is beneficial 
    for neural networks as it ensures uniform input dimensions, which is often required for efficient processing. 
    Additionally, resizing help in reducing computational complexity and memory requirements.

4. Translation and Rotation: 

    The `translation` and `rotation` methods perform geometric transformations 
    on the image data. These transformations enhance the network's ability to generalize by introducing 
    variations and augmenting the training dataset. By applying random translations and rotations, the network 
    becomes more robust to changes in position and orientation of the objects in the images.

.. note::
   By applying these preprocessing techniques, the `CreeBD` class simplifies the image data and prepares 
   it for the neural network training process. 

   The simplified representations help the network focus on relevant patterns and features, 
   reduce the impact of noise or irrelevant information, and improve the 
   network's ability to learn and generalize from the data. 

   Ultimately, preprocessing contributes to enhancing 
   the neural network's performance, accuracy, and efficiency in solving the given problem.
