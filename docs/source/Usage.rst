To use the Industrial_Vision library please follow the installation steps outlined below.

Installation
------------

1. **Prerequisites**\: Ensure that you have Python 3.9 installed on your system. 
If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python 
website (https://www.python.org).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**\: It is recommended to create a 
virtual environment to keep the project dependencies isolated. Open a terminal 
or command prompt and run the following commands\:

- On macOS and Linux\:

.. code-block:: console
    
    python3 -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate

- On Windows\:
   
.. code-block:: console

    python -m venv myenv
    myenv\Scripts\activate
   

3. **Install Required Packages**\: In the activated virtual environment or your 
global Python environment, run the following command to install the necessary packages\:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -r requirements.txt



4. **Download Industrial_Vision Library**\: Download the Industrial_Vision library 
from the project repository or source. You can either clone the repository or 
download the source code as a ZIP file.

- If you are using Git, clone the repository by running the following command
     in your terminal or command prompt\:
    
.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
     

- If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to a directory of your choice.

5. **Importing the Library**\: Once the library is downloaded, navigate to the 
project directory and import it into your Python script or interactive session 
using the following import statement\:

.. code-block:: python

    import Industrial_Vision
   

.. tip::

    Now that you have all the necessary prerequisites 
    and dependencies installed, and don't forget to consult the library's documentation 
    for further guidance on usage and the different algorithms.
